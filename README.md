# Friend Recommendation System with Graph-Based Visualization

Welcome to the **Friend Recommendation System**! 🎉
This is a student-friendly social network simulation that uses graph traversal algorithms (**BFS** and **DFS**) to recommend new friends. You can visualize your social graph, add/delete friends, and interact with your network via a simple and intuitive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

> Just open `index.html` in any modern browser — **no installation required!**

---

## 🧠 Features

* ✅ Add Friends (creates a connection/edge in the graph)
* ❌ Delete Friends
* 📜 View All Friend Connections
* 🔍 Friend Recommendations:

  * **BFS** – Recommends closest (mutual) friends
  * **DFS** – Recommends deep/long-chain connections
* 📊 Interactive graph visualization (using HTML Canvas)
* 🖥️ Responsive, clean design (works on desktop & mobile)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── index.html        # Main HTML file (UI + logic)
├── style.css         # Styling (if separated)
└── script.js         # Logic & algorithms (if separated)
```

> In this version, everything is contained inside `index.html` for simplicity.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

```
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/friend-recommendation-system.git
$ cd friend-recommendation-system
$ start index.html     # Or simply double-click on it
```

No server or compiler needed – it runs in the browser!

## 🧑‍🎓 Educational Purpose

This project is designed for learning and demonstrating:

* Graph theory concepts (nodes, edges, adjacency)
* BFS vs DFS algorithms
* UI/UX basics for algorithm-based systems
* Interactive visualization via HTML Canvas

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

*  Backend integration using Flask or WebAssembly (to run native C code in-browser)
*  Persistent data using browser `localStorage` or IndexedDB
*  Multiple users/accounts with login and friend management
*  Advanced visual graph layout (with vis.js, D3.js, or force-directed graph layout)
*  Weighted edges (for stronger/weaker friend ties)
*  Dark mode toggle
*  Search functionality in the friend network
*  Export/import social graphs (as JSON or CSV)
*  Analytics on friend recommendations (e.g., most recommended users)
